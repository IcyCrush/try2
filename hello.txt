Embracing Change in the Tech Industry: 
The Learn, Unlearn, Relearn Mantra


Do you really think you qualifications from years ago are relevant now?

work hard and play by rules’-old era
Constantly evolve strategies, unlearn what worked well many years back, and set the tone for relearning. 


lifelong learners are the ones who can maintain momentum and productivity even in case of a radical change at work.


Illiterate of the 21st Century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those cannot learn, unlearn and relearn “
